# Linux_configs
Configs for zsh and vim

## zsh
The .zshrc file is configured for using with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).<br>
And you can use 'please' instead of 'sudo' :)

## vim
After placing the .vimrc in your home-directory, enter ':PlugInstall' to install the plugins.<br>
After that, you may want to go into ~/vim/plugged/youcompleteme and run 'python3 install.py --all' for auto-complete on a lot of languages ([More info here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/youcompleteme)).<br>
NerdTree, a in vim file explorere, is mapped to CTRL + n.
